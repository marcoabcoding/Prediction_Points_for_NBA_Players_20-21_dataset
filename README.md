# NBA Player Prediction Points. A Machine Learning project using Python
This project implements a machine learning model to predict NBA player points. The dataset was extracted through web scraping, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA). Multiple models were tested, and fine-tuning was performed using Grid Search to optimize performance.

Key Features:

Data Collection: NBA player statistics were scraped from the web.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into player performance and statistical distributions were derived.
Modeling: Various machine learning algorithms were tested.
Model Optimization: Fine-tuning was carried out using Grid Search to enhance model accuracy.
